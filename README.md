I decided to remove manjaro and arch because it was useless
So this script works on ubuntu, debian or alpine or other distros based off of them. I have shortened the package update commands into a small script. Enjoy!

For debian and ubuntu or distros based on them which use apt:
- run: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/themoonmeetsthesun/linux-updater/master/updatedebbased.sh`
- run: `sh updatedebbased.sh`

For alpine or distros based on it which use apk:
- run: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/themoonmeetsthesun/linux-updater/master/updatealpbased.sh`
- run: `sh updatealpbased.sh`
