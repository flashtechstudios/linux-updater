So this script only works on ubuntu or debian or distros based on them. I have shortened the package update commands into a small script. Enjoy!

To run it:
- Go to this webpage to download the repo: https://github.com/Devesh3293/linux-updater/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
- Extract it.
- Put it anywhere you want.
- Go inside the folder
- run sh update.sh
